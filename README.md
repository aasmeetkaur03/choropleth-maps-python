# 🌍 Choropleth Maps in Python

This Repository showcases my Exploration of *Choropleth Maps* — a Powerful Way to Visualize Geographical Data through Color Intensity.  
It demonstrates how *Data Meets Geography* to Uncover Patterns, Insights and Trends using Python.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Through this Project I explored various global and U.S.-based datasets to build interactive and static *Choropleth Maps* that highlight data such as:
- 🗺 U.S. Agricultural Exports (2011)
- 🗳 U.S. Election Data (2012)
- 🌐 Global GDP (2014)

Each visualization helps understand how Numerical Data can be Beautifully Mapped over Geographic Boundaries.
